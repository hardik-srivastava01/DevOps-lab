# Day 16 – Git & GitHub Fundamentals

## Objective

Learn the fundamentals of Version Control Systems (VCS), Git, and GitHub. Understand how developers track changes, collaborate on projects, and manage source code using Git.

---

# What is Version Control System (VCS)?

A **Version Control System (VCS)** is a tool that tracks changes made to files over time, allowing developers to manage different versions, collaborate with others, and restore previous versions if needed.

### Why VCS is Important?

- Tracks every change in code.
- Enables team collaboration.
- Restores previous versions if mistakes occur.
- Prevents code conflicts.
- Maintains project history.

### Examples

- Git
- Subversion (SVN)
- Mercurial

---

# What is Git?

**Git** is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code and manage software development projects efficiently.

### Features of Git

- Fast and lightweight
- Distributed architecture
- Branching and merging
- Offline support
- Complete history tracking

### Real DevOps Use Cases

- Source code management
- CI/CD integration
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Team collaboration

---

# What is GitHub?

**GitHub** is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories, enabling developers to collaborate, review code, and manage projects online.

### GitHub Provides

- Remote repositories
- Collaboration
- Pull Requests
- Issues
- Actions (CI/CD)
- Project management

# Git vs GitHub

| Git | GitHub |
|------|---------|
| Version Control System | Cloud hosting platform |
| Works locally | Works online |
| Tracks code changes | Stores Git repositories |
| No internet required | Internet required |
| Command-line tool | Web-based platform |

---

# What is a Repository?

A **Repository (Repo)** is a storage location that contains a project's files, folders, commit history, and version information.

### Types

- Local Repository
- Remote Repository

Example:

```
DevOps-Lab/
├── Linux/
├── Docker/
├── Kubernetes/
└── README.md
```

---

# What is a Commit?

A **Commit** is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. Every commit records the changes made since the previous commit.

Example:

```
Commit 1 → Initial Project

Commit 2 → Added Linux Notes

Commit 3 → Fixed Git Errors
```

Each commit has:

- Unique Commit ID (SHA)
- Author
- Date & Time
- Commit Message

---

# Working Directory

The **Working Directory** is where you create, edit, or delete project files before Git starts tracking the changes.

Example:

```
README.md
Notes.md
Practice.md
```

These files are modified here first.

---

# Staging Area

The **Staging Area** (Index) is an intermediate area where selected changes are prepared before creating a commit.

Command:

```bash
git add .
```

Purpose:

- Select specific changes.
- Review before committing.
- Create clean commit history.

---

# Local Repository

The **Local Repository** is stored on your own computer. It contains the complete project history and allows you to work even without an internet connection.

Example:

```
Laptop
│
└── DevOps-Lab
```

---

# Remote Repository

A **Remote Repository** is stored on platforms like GitHub and is used for collaboration, backup, and sharing code.

Example:

```
GitHub
│
└── DevOps-Lab
```

Developers push local commits to the remote repository using Git.

---

# Git Workflow

```

# Real DevOps Use Cases

## DevOps Engineer

- Store Infrastructure as Code.
- Maintain CI/CD pipelines.
- Track configuration changes.
- Collaborate with teams.

## SRE Engineer

- Track production fixes.
- Maintain automation scripts.
- Roll back faulty changes.

## Cloud Engineer

- Version cloud infrastructure.
- Manage Terraform configurations.
- Collaborate on deployment scripts.

---

# Common Mistakes

- Committing directly without reviewing changes.
- Writing unclear commit messages.
- Confusing Git with GitHub.
- Forgetting to push local commits.
- Working on the wrong branch.

---

# Key Takeaway

Git is the version control system that tracks changes locally, while GitHub is the cloud platform used to host and share Git repositories. Understanding the Git workflow—Working Directory → Staging Area → Local Repository → Remote Repository—is the foundation of collaborative software development and modern DevOps practices.
